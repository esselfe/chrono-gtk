chrono is a terminal ncurses-based and/or X11-based windowed chronometer with
millisecond precision, days, months & years, countdown, pause and reset
function. It is written in the C programming language and can be compiled
by running:
'./configure && make' from the source directory.

The latest available source code is @ https://github.com/cody1632/chrono

Note that you will need the ncurses development headers,
ie: /usr/include/ncursesw/ncurses.h. You can run
'sudo apt install libncurses5-dev' on Debian/DEB-based Linux systems, or
'sudo yum install ncurses-devel' on RedHat/RPM-based systems.
Optionally the X11 headers will be checked during the configure, which can be
installed by running:
'sudo apt install libX11-dev' or
'yum install libX11-devel'

You can add these options to the configure script:
--disable-ncurses    To disable terminal-based interface
--disable-x11        To disable GUI-based interface
The default is to enable both if preset. Note that one or both options are
required to be enabled for the program to provide minimal functions.

chrono options are:
	-h, --help       Show this help message
	-c, --countdown  Count using one of these formats:
					 15, 1:15, 1:30:45, 2:10:5:0, 4:2:0:0:0 or y:m:d:h:m:s
	-s, --seconds    Display seconds instead of milliseconds
	-t, --test       Perform debugging tests and exit
	-V, --version    Show program version and exit

If X11 support are enabled, these options become available:
	-S, --sticky     Show window on all desktops
	-x, --X11        Use the X11 GUI
	-W, --width      Set the window horizontal size
	-H, --height     Set the window vertical size
	-X, --position-x Set the window horizontal position
	-Y, --position-y Set the window vertical position
The -x option is not available if built without ncurses support

Once chrono is started, you can press:
'p' or <Space> pause and unpause,
'q' or <Escape> quit
'r' reset the counter
's' toggle seconds only
